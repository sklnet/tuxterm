Only tested with compiling inside OE so far, dont know if it smoothly works inside the tuxbox CDK.
I use to compile this inside the OE devshell, just do a "autotools_do_configure" and "make" and
it should work.
The source works for mipsel (7025) as well as for the ppc boxes, you only have to define the 8bit/32bit
framebuffer setting inside the main.h

// 8Bit/32Bit Framebuffer ?
#define FB8BIT

Just uncomment this inside the main.h to compile the 32bit framebuffer version (Dreambox 7025).
